             <p class="left-side">St. Joseph’s Hospital exists because people need good medical care close to home provided by good people who care about them. St. Joseph’s has always played a critical role in the quality of life for residents of greater Washington County.</p>
             
             <p class="left-side">The hospital is the first line of defense against acute disease and injury. It is where lives are saved and new ones begin. </p>
             
             <p class="has-image left-side"><img src="images/2092-SJH-1930-1.png" alt="St-Joseph's Hospital circa 1930" /></p>
             
             <p class="left-side">In 1930, the construction of St. Joseph’s Hospital, a four-story brick building on what was at that time the edge of West Bend, a city of about 4,000 people, began. The need for a modern hospital to serve the entire community was quite evident. Prior to this, doctors treated patients at home or in one of the small, private residences that served as a hospital.</p>
             
             <p class="has-image left-side"><img src="images/2092-SJH-1977-1.png" alt="St-Joseph's Hospital circa 1974" /></p>
             
             <p class="right-side nobr">Doctors and community leaders worked out an agreement with the Sisters of the Divine Savior to jointly finance the 25-bed hospital. The local American Legion Post generously donated a site and, once completed, the Sisters took over and operated the hospital. This marked a new era in medical care for residents living in this area. </p>
             
             <p class="right-side">Over the years technology changed the way health care was delivered and how business was conducted. The hospital continued to expand in size and faced rapid changes throughout the organization in the areas of patient care, compliance and quality reporting requirements. New services and programs were added in order to meet the changing needs of those living and working in the community. </p>
             
             <p class="right-side has-image"><img src="images/2092-SJH-2005-1.png" alt="St-Joseph's Hospital circa 2005" /></p>
             
             <p class="right-side">In 2005 after outgrowing the original structure and multiple expansions, the current St. Joseph’s Hospital was built. It was a tribute to the past 75 years of service to the community and incorporated the vision of the area’s future health care needs and room for growth.</p>

        	<p>Health care is more than a professional relationship between a physician and their patient. It is a partnership between individuals that are committed to those living and working in the communities served.</p>
            
            <p>St. Joseph’s Community Foundation is the official gift-receiving arm for Froedtert Health St. Joseph’s Hospital, the Kathy Hospice and Kramer Cancer Center. A 501(c)(3) organization, the Foundation works together with hospital administration to identify programs, services or needs that will lead to an exceptional patient care experience, at every opportunity.</p>
            
            <p>The Foundation was created in 2002 by a dedicated group of individuals who realized the importance and need for local health care services, close to home. These individuals, and others, comprise a Board of Directors that is committed to raising and providing financial resources in support of the hospital that will directly benefit the patients and families we have the privilege to provide care for. </p>
            
            <p>The Foundation plays an important role and provides financial resources for department needs throughout the hospital that directly impact patient care. </p>
            
            <p>The work of the Foundation would not be possible if it weren’t for the generosity of our donors, patients, families and employees. It is because of their desire to make a difference, and the actions they have taken by making a contribution, that access to quality health care in the communities which they live and work is possible. </p>
            
            <p>The Foundation is the means by which a grateful patient, family, business or community organization can share their gratitude and support and make a lasting impact on the ever-changing face of health care.</p>
            
            <p>Gifts to the Foundation are an investment in quality, local health care that will impact not only you and your family, but many generations to come. </p>
            
            <p>Help us to continue the stories of our patients that have spanned many generations and consider a gift to St. Joseph’s Community Foundation. Support our goal of providing an exceptional patient care experience, every opportunity we are given.</p>
            
            <p>Everyone has the ability to make a difference at some point in their life. It’s up to you to determine what it is you will do. </p>
