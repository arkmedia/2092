            <p>Froedtert Health St. Joseph’s Hospital is here when a person is most vulnerable and also when they least expect it. Our physicians, nurses, staff and volunteers strive to ensure that every interaction our patients, families and visitors have is handled with personalized, trusted care.</p>
            
            <p>Health care is more than just medicine. It is the development of a relationship and often involves a story.
It is about interactions on the most basic and personal level between the patient, nurse, physician and family. It can affect your physical, emotional and spiritual senses.</p>

			<p>As your community hospital, it is our responsibility to provide you and your family exceptional care, close to home. St. Joseph’s Hospital has provided the communities in greater Washington County with quality health care and services for many generations.</p>

			<p>When someone makes a gift, another receives. The generous contributions of the individuals included in this Generations of Giving program not only strengthen our community but support the health and well-being of the individuals, families and local businesses that make up a community. </p>

			<p>It is because of the generosity of previous generations that access to quality, local health care and the specialty services of an academic medical center are available at this community hospital. </p>

			<p>Please take a moment to learn more about the history of St. Joseph’s Hospital, the donors who are committed to quality health care close to home, and how St. Joseph’s collaborates with other community leaders in identifying and addressing community health needs and concerns.</p>

the lighter jQuery 2.x which is smaller because it does not support 
pre-HTML5 browsers and I'm confident that the full release version 
will be completed before the lauch date of this project.
