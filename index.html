            <p>At St. Joseph’s Hospital, the Partners volunteer organization is comprised of over 165 adult volunteers and “volun-teens” that support our patients, families, visitors and staff in a variety of ways and in almost every department within the hospital, the Kathy Hospice and Kraemer Cancer Center.</p>

			<p>Volunteers have been serving St. Joseph’s Hospital since 1937. What began with a group of women known as the Pink Ladies, they later changed their name to the Guild, and then the Auxiliary, as the years passed. This committed group of both women and men are now known as the Partners of St. Joseph’s Hospital.</p>

			<p>Volunteers of all ages give generously of their time and talents in the Partner organization.</p>

			<p>Annually, they provide over 17,000 hours of service and are the faces you see at the greeter desks, in the Well Wisher Gift Shop and transporting patients to different areas throughout the hospital and clinics.</p>

			<p>They are the friendly face, in the green vest, that is ready and willing to provide directions, share a warm smile or offer conversation as patients and visitors move throughout their appointments or wait for a loved one.</p>
            
            <p>We are proud of our commitment to the health and well-being of our area residents. Please join us in helping to make Washington County a healthier place to live, work and raise a family.</p>
                        
            <p>The Partner volunteers are a very important aspect to the personalized, trusted care provided at St. Joseph’s Hospital.</p>
                        
            <p>They are community members who understand the importance of having quality health care and a state-of-the art facility, close to home. They have been your friends, family, neighbors, business professionals and community leaders that have a heart of gold and a passion for helping others.</p>

            <p>St. Joseph’s Community Foundation is fortunate to be the recipient of the community-organized fundraisers “Daniel Rozek Memorial Classic Golf Outing” and “Element of Art Night”. These events are especially important and their success is due to the hundreds of committed and thoughtful volunteers and business leaders who share their time and talent to raise funds for a cause they truly believe in.</p>
            
            <p>St. Joseph’s Community Foundation also organizes a fundraiser each year that impacts many lives. Proceeds from this event have provided additional patient care and program resources for the Kraemer Cancer Center that would otherwise not have been possible.</p>

        	<p>Health care is more than a professional relationship between a physician and their patient. It is a partnership between individuals that are committed to those living and working in the communities served.</p>
            
            <p>St. Joseph’s Community Foundation is the official gift-receiving arm for Froedtert Health St. Joseph’s Hospital, the Kathy Hospice and Kramer Cancer Center. A 501(c)(3) organization, the Foundation works together with hospital administration to identify programs, services or needs that will lead to an exceptional patient care experience, at every opportunity.</p>
            
            <p>The Foundation was created in 2002 by a dedicated group of individuals who realized the importance and need for local health care services, close to home. These individuals, and others, comprise a Board of Directors that is committed to raising and providing financial resources in support of the hospital that will directly benefit the patients and families we have the privilege to provide care for. </p>
            
            <p style="display:inline-block">The Foundation plays an important role and provides financial resources for department needs throughout the hospital that directly impact patient care. </p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: -10px !important; display:inline-block">The work of the Foundation would not be possible if it weren’t for the generosity of our donors, patients, families and employees. It is because of their desire to make a difference, and the actions they have taken by making a contribution, that access to quality health care in the communities which they live and work is possible. </p>
            
            <p>The Foundation is the means by which a grateful patient, family, business or community organization can share their gratitude and support and make a lasting impact on the ever-changing face of health care.</p>
            
            <p>Gifts to the Foundation are an investment in quality, local health care that will impact not only you and your family, but many generations to come. </p>
            
            <p>Help us to continue the stories of our patients that have spanned many generations and consider a gift to St. Joseph’s Community Foundation. Support our goal of providing an exceptional patient care experience, every opportunity we are given.</p>
            
            <p>Everyone has the ability to make a difference at some point in their life. It’s up to you to determine what it is you will do. </p>

             <p class="left-side">St. Joseph’s Hospital exists because people need good medical care close to home provided by good people who care about them. St. Joseph’s has always played a critical role in the quality of life for residents of greater Washington County.</p>
             
             <p class="left-side">The hospital is the first line of defense against acute disease and injury. It is where lives are saved and new ones begin. </p>
             
             <p class="has-image left-side"><img src="images/2092-SJH-1930-1.png" alt="St-Joseph's Hospital circa 1930" /></p>
             
             <p class="left-side">In 1930, the construction of St. Joseph’s Hospital, a four-story brick building on what was at that time the edge of West Bend, a city of about 4,000 people, began. The need for a modern hospital to serve the entire community was quite evident. Prior to this, doctors treated patients at home or in one of the small, private residences that served as a hospital.</p>
             
             <p class="has-image left-side"><img src="images/2092-SJH-1977-1.png" alt="St-Joseph's Hospital circa 1974" /></p>
             
             <p class="right-side nobr">Doctors and community leaders worked out an agreement with the Sisters of the Divine Savior to jointly finance the 25-bed hospital. The local American Legion Post generously donated a site and, once completed, the Sisters took over and operated the hospital. This marked a new era in medical care for residents living in this area. </p>
             
             <p class="right-side">Over the years technology changed the way health care was delivered and how business was conducted. The hospital continued to expand in size and faced rapid changes throughout the organization in the areas of patient care, compliance and quality reporting requirements. New services and programs were added in order to meet the changing needs of those living and working in the community. </p>
             
             <p class="right-side has-image"><img src="images/2092-SJH-2005-1.png" alt="St-Joseph's Hospital circa 2005" /></p>
             
             <p class="right-side">In 2005 after outgrowing the original structure and multiple expansions, the current St. Joseph’s Hospital was built. It was a tribute to the past 75 years of service to the community and incorporated the vision of the area’s future health care needs and room for growth.</p>

            <p>Alyce Kraemer was not one who sought recognition. She simply and quietly enjoyed helping others and appreciated opportunities when she could give back to the community in which she lived for over 80 years.</p>
            
            <p>In 1998 at the age of 95, Mrs. Kraemer provided an anonymous gift of $2 Million on behalf of herself and her husband, Elmore Kraemer, to the cancer care center at what was then known as St. Joseph’s Community Hospital. It wasn’t until she passed away in 2004, at the age of 101, that the anonymous donor’s name was revealed along with her generous spirit.</p>

			<p style="display:inline-block">Mrs. Kraemer was a school teacher and taught Kindergarten in West Bend for six years in the 1920’s. Her classes included students who, generations later, were from families that continue to support the Kraemer Cancer Center and what has now become Froedtert Health St. Joseph’s Hospital.</p>

			<p>Mrs. Kraemer enjoyed being able to see while she was still living how her donation benefitted others. She provided the support she did out of the goodness of her heart and without the need to be recognized. Not only was she a teacher by trade, but through her kindness and generosity she provided a true life lesson about giving back, and the importance of supporting the community in which you live and work.</p>

            <p>“Never underestimate your own abilities, as you are probably better than you thought you were.” Ray Moser, a lifelong resident of West Bend, shares this thought with many people as he travels throughout the country as an accomplished trap shooter. His advice provides encouragement to a younger generation of trap shooters.</p>
            
            <p>Little did Ray know that by “never underestimating” what he could do would make a difference for the Alyce and Elmore Kraemer Cancer Care Center of St. Joseph’s Hospital. In January 2010, Ray generously contributed $20,060 to the center in memory of the love of his life, Wyleene Moser, who lost her battle with lung cancer in October 2009. Ray and “Wy,” as she was affectionately known, met when Ray asked her to dance the Blue Tango. They continued their love for dancing on a weekly basis for over 55 years.</p>

			<p>Ray’s gift will benefit patients and families receiving care at the Cancer Care Center. It is a wonderful way to remember the life and love Ray and Wy shared. It is also a reminder that there are incredibly talented people in all walks of life who, when given the opportunity, choose to make a difference.</p>

            	<p style="margin-top:0px;">The Kathy Hospice, nestled in a gently sloping valley on the St. Joseph’s Hospital campus, opened in February 2006 and is named in memory of Kathy Komas, who passed away from cancer in 2002.</p>
                
                <p>The Kathy Hospice was made possible by a generous lead gift and commitment on the part of Ron Komas, Kathy’s husband. The campaign to build eight private patient suites was conducted by St. Joseph’s Community Foundation.</p> 
                <p>This facility serves an important community need. It is designed for individuals with a terminal illness and is dedicated to providing supportive, palliative care in a peaceful, home-like setting. </p> 
                
                <p>Contributions to the Kathy Hospice play a critical role in supporting this important community resource. Gifts to the hospice benefit three key areas and may be designated according to the donor’s wishes.</p>
