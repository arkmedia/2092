            <p>Froedtert Health St. Joseph’s Hospital is here when a person is most vulnerable and also when they least expect it. Our physicians, nurses, staff and volunteers strive to ensure that every interaction our patients, families and visitors have is handled with personalized, trusted care.</p>
            
            <p>Health care is more than just medicine. It is the development of a relationship and often involves a story.
It is about interactions on the most basic and personal level between the patient, nurse, physician and family. It can affect your physical, emotional and spiritual senses.</p>

			<p>As your community hospital, it is our responsibility to provide you and your family exceptional care, close to home. St. Joseph’s Hospital has provided the communities in greater Washington County with quality health care and services for many generations.</p>

			<p>When someone makes a gift, another receives. The generous contributions of the individuals included in this Generations of Giving program not only strengthen our community but support the health and well-being of the individuals, families and local businesses that make up a community. </p>

			<p>It is because of the generosity of previous generations that access to quality, local health care and the specialty services of an academic medical center are available at this community hospital. </p>

			<p>Please take a moment to learn more about the history of St. Joseph’s Hospital, the donors who are committed to quality health care close to home, and how St. Joseph’s collaborates with other community leaders in identifying and addressing community health needs and concerns.</p>
            
            <p>We are proud of our commitment to the health and well-being of our area residents. Please join us in helping to make Washington County a healthier place to live, work and raise a family.</p>

        	<p>Health care is more than a professional relationship between a physician and their patient. It is a partnership between individuals that are committed to those living and working in the communities served.</p>
            
            <p>St. Joseph’s Community Foundation is the official gift-receiving arm for Froedtert Health St. Joseph’s Hospital, the Kathy Hospice and Kramer Cancer Center. A 501(c)(3) organization, the Foundation works together with hospital administration to identify programs, services or needs that will lead to an exceptional patient care experience, at every opportunity.</p>
            
            <p>The Foundation was created in 2002 by a dedicated group of individuals who realized the importance and need for local health care services, close to home. These individuals, and others, comprise a Board of Directors that is committed to raising and providing financial resources in support of the hospital that will directly benefit the patients and families we have the privilege to provide care for. </p>
            
            <p>The Foundation plays an important role and provides financial resources for department needs throughout the hospital that directly impact patient care. </p>
            
            <p>The work of the Foundation would not be possible if it weren’t for the generosity of our donors, patients, families and employees. It is because of their desire to make a difference, and the actions they have taken by making a contribution, that access to quality health care in the communities which they live and work is possible. </p>
            
            <p>The Foundation is the means by which a grateful patient, family, business or community organization can share their gratitude and support and make a lasting impact on the ever-changing face of health care.</p>
            
            <p>Gifts to the Foundation are an investment in quality, local health care that will impact not only you and your family, but many generations to come. </p>
            
            <p>Help us to continue the stories of our patients that have spanned many generations and consider a gift to St. Joseph’s Community Foundation. Support our goal of providing an exceptional patient care experience, every opportunity we are given.</p>
            
            <p>Everyone has the ability to make a difference at some point in their life. It’s up to you to determine what it is you will do. </p>
