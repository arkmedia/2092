             <p class="left-side">St. Joseph’s Hospital exists because people need good medical care close to home provided by good people who care about them. St. Joseph’s has always played a critical role in the quality of life for residents of greater Washington County.</p>
             
             <p class="left-side">The hospital is the first line of defense against acute disease and injury. It is where lives are saved and new ones begin. </p>
             
             <p class="has-image left-side"><img src="images/2092-SJH-1930-1.png" alt="St-Joseph's Hospital circa 1930" /></p>
             
             <p class="left-side">In 1930, the construction of St. Joseph’s Hospital, a four-story brick building on what was at that time the edge of West Bend, a city of about 4,000 people, began. The need for a modern hospital to serve the entire community was quite evident. Prior to this, doctors treated patients at home or in one of the small, private residences that served as a hospital.</p>
             
             <p class="has-image left-side"><img src="images/2092-SJH-1977-1.png" alt="St-Joseph's Hospital circa 1974" /></p>
             
             <p class="right-side nobr">Doctors and community leaders worked out an agreement with the Sisters of the Divine Savior to jointly finance the 25-bed hospital. The local American Legion Post generously donated a site and, once completed, the Sisters took over and operated the hospital. This marked a new era in medical care for residents living in this area. </p>
             
             <p class="right-side">Over the years technology changed the way health care was delivered and how business was conducted. The hospital continued to expand in size and faced rapid changes throughout the organization in the areas of patient care, compliance and quality reporting requirements. New services and programs were added in order to meet the changing needs of those living and working in the community. </p>
             
             <p class="right-side has-image"><img src="images/2092-SJH-2005-1.png" alt="St-Joseph's Hospital circa 2005" /></p>
             
             <p class="right-side">In 2005 after outgrowing the original structure and multiple expansions, the current St. Joseph’s Hospital was built. It was a tribute to the past 75 years of service to the community and incorporated the vision of the area’s future health care needs and room for growth.</p>
